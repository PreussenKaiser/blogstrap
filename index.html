                <p>
                    This site is here so I can mess around with Bootstrap.
                    I'm thinking about turning it into a blog at some point.

                <h3>Cover Page</h3>
                <p>
                    On second thought, I could have have this as my main page, with links to the rest of my stuff.
                    I know of a template I could use where the header turns into a navbar and I could have it link to other things.

                <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
                <p>
                    This seems pretty cool, once I get the hang of things I'll probably be able to create mobile friendly websites fairly quickly.
                    Making sure my site was mobile ready has been kind of an afterthought, I should focus on that a lot more since most sites are viewed by mobile devices now.
